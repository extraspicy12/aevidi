									<p>By using the nifty contact form we have at the bottom of every page, you can send us an outline of everything you would
										need on a website. Maybe you already have a few images or a logo. Anything that could add to a visual description of your
										site is helpful. After we get all the information about what your site needs, we will send you a quote for the work. If
										a price is agreed upon, then we will proceed to the next step in the process.</p>

									<p>This is where the real communication happens. We take everything we discussed in the initial modes of communication and
										create graphical mockups of what our vision of the website would look like. From there, we will engage in a back-and-forth
										with you to tailor the site to meet your vision. The next step is to develop and design the website from the finalized
										mockup that we agree on. We will be in contact throughout that process in case any changes or executive decisions need
										to be made.</p>

									<p>This is the point in the process where we finally get your website online. We will work with you to purchase a webhost

										and upload content that you create.</p>
